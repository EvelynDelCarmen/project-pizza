# pizza-project

A project to practice the basic of Javascript and order yummy italian food, of course.

## The problem

I had problems towards the end, since I am a total beginner of this I am still learning the logic in all of this. I had problem connecting my "order" variable with the "age" prompt. I google a lot, trying to understand the storage of a variable. Ask my awesome team mates when I got really stuck and my brain did not function.
